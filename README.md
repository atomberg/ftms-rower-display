## FTMS

The FTMS (FiTness Machine Service) protocol allows you to interact with many different fitness machines
regardless of the brand. 
It is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol that follows a [standard defined by Bluetooth Sig](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/fitness-machine-service-1-0/).

You can read more about FTMS in this [blogpost](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/take-control-of-your-fitness-machines-6588439aeeda)
